# 2.7  Administrative/Biographical History Element

A description of the context in which the materials being described were created, assembled, accumulated, and/or maintained is as important as the description of the materials themselves.  One of the most significant aspects of the description of the context of creation is the Administrative/Biographical History Element.  Such descriptions may be a part of the description of the materials, but they may also be created and stored in an authority system separate from the description of the materials.  To facilitate such systems, the rules for creating an administrative or biographical history are provided in Part II, Chapter 10.  The rules apply to either situationâ€”administrative history and biographical information as part of the description of the materials or as maintained in a separate authority system.
