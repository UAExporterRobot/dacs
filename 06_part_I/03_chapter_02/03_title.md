# 2.3 Title (Required)

## Purpose and Scope

This element provides a word or phrase by which the material being described is known or can be identified. A title may be devised or formal.

  Commentary: A devised title is one provided by the archivist when there is no formal title for the materials being described or when the formal title is misleading or inadequate. The rules for recording a devised title differ from the rules for recording a formal title. Archivists usually devise titles for archival materials.

Devised titles generally have two parts:

* the name of the creator(s) or collector(s)

* the nature of the materials being described

A formal title is one that appears prominently on or in the materials being described and is most commonly found in material that has been published or distributed, such as a title on a book, report, map, or film. Formal titles can also be found on unpublished material that bears a meaningful name consciously given by the creator of the material, (e.g., a caption on a photograph, label on a folder, or leader on a film).

In the absence of a meaningful formal title, a title must be devised. The archivist must use professional judgment to determine when it is appropriate to devise a title rather than transcribe a label on a container that may be misleading. When they occur at all in archival materials, formal titles are most commonly found on files or items.

## Sources of Information

2.3.1 When devising a title, take the information from any reliable source, including the internal evidence of the materials being described, an external source such as a records schedule or communication with a donor, or a title on another copy or version of the materials being described.

2.3.2 When recording a formal title, transcribe the information according to the appropriate standard. Some companion standards are suggested in Appendix B. Rules for transcribing formal titles are not provided here.

## General Rules

2.3.3 When devising title information, compose a brief title<sup>(#footnote1)[1]</sup> that uniquely identifies the material, normally consisting of a name segment, a term indicating the nature of the unit being described,<sup>(#footnote2)[2]</sup> and optionally a topical segment as instructed in the following rules. Do not enclose devised titles in square brackets.

  Commentary:

  * In multilevel descriptions the name segment may be inherited from a higher level
  of description and may not need to be explicitly stated at lower levels.

  * When the repository is responsible for assembling a collection, provide, as part of the devised title, the institution’s name as the collector.

  * The topical segment should be used only when the identification of the material
  cannot be made clear from the name and nature elements.

## Name Segment

Establish a consistent policy for selecting the name of the corporate body to be used in the title.

## Nature of the Archival Unit
2.3.19 Archival materials are frequently described by devised aggregate terms such as papers (for personal materials), records (for organizational materials), or collection (for topical aggregations). However, other terms are also used. The term(s) used to describe the nature of archival materials should be comprehensible to the institution’s patrons. Titles should be constructed in a coherent and consistent format according to the rules of the individual institution.
