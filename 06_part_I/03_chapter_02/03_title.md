# 2.3  Title Element

## Purpose and Scope
This element provides a word or phrase by which the material being described is known or can be identified.  A title may be supplied or formal.

Commentary:  A supplied title is one provided by the archivist when there is no formal title for the materials being described, or where the formal title is misleading or inadequate.  The rules for recording a supplied title differ from the rules for recording a formal title.  Archivists usually supply titles for archival materials.

Supplied titles generally have two parts:
* the name of the creator(s) or collector(s)
* the nature of the materials being described

A formal title is one that appears prominently on or in the materials being described and is most commonly found in material that has been published or distributed, such as a title on a book, report, map, or film.  Formal titles can also be found on unpublished material that bears a meaningful name consciously given by the creator of the material, (e.g., a caption on a photograph, label on a folder, or leader on a film).

In the absence of a meaningful formal title, a title must be supplied.  The archivist must use professional judgment to determine when it is appropriate to supply a title rather than transcribing a label on a container that may be misleading.  When they occur at all in archival materials, formal titles are most commonly found on files or items.

## Sources of Information
**2.3.1.**  When supplying a title, take the information from any reliable source, including the internal evidence of the materials being described, an external source such as a records schedule or communication with a donor, or a title on another copy or version of the materials being described.

**2.3.2.**  When recording a formal title, transcribe the information from the prescribed source as described in the appropriate chapters in AACR2 (which specify that formal titles are recorded exactly as to wording, order, and spelling, but not necessarily as to punctuation or capitalization) or to specialized standards for various types of material cited in Appendix B.  Rules for transcribing formal titles are not provided here.

## General Rules
**2.3.3.**  When supplying title information, compose a brief title<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup> that uniquely identifies the material, normally consisting of a name segment, a term indicating the nature of the unit being described <sup>[2](#footnote2)</sup>, and optionally a topical segment as instructed in the following rules.  Do not enclose supplied titles in square brackets.

Commentary:
In multilevel descriptions the name segment may be inherited from a higher level of description and may not need to be explicitly stated at lower levels.
When the repository is responsible for assembling a collection, do not provide, as part of the supplied title, the institution's name as the collector.
The topical segment should be used only when the identification of the material cannot be made clear from the name and nature elements.

## Name segment
**2.3.4.**  Record the name(s) of the person(s), family (families), or corporate body <sup>[3](#footnote3)</sup> predominantly responsible for the creation, assembly, accumulation, and/or maintenance of the materials.

**2.3.5.**  Record the name(s) in the form by which the creator or collector is generally known <sup>[4](#footnote4)</sup>. Record the name(s) in the natural language order of the language of the person’s or corporate body’s country of residence or activity or the official language of the corporate body.  The name may be abbreviated if a fuller form of the name appears elsewhere in the descriptive record (e.g., in the administrative/biographical history) or as an access point.

**2.3.6.**  If the name of the creator, assembler, or collector is not known, or if the repository has assembled the materials, do not record a name.  In such cases, supply the nature of the archival materials for the title as instructed in rules 2.3.18-2.3.20 and 2.3.22.

## Name segment for more than one person
**2.3.7.**  If three or fewer persons are credited with, or predominantly responsible for, the creation of the materials as a whole, record their names in direct order.

**2.3.8.**  If responsibility for the creation of the materials is dispersed among more than three persons, record the name of the individual whose material predominates. If this does not apply, choose the name considered most appropriate.

**2.3.9.**  Optionally, include all the names of the persons who are credited with or predominantly responsible for the creation of the materials.

## Name segment for families
**2.3.10.**  If the materials were created, assembled, accumulated, and/or used in the context of familial relations by individuals who share a common surname, record that name followed by the word “family.”

**2.3.15.**  Optionally, include all the names of the families who are credited with, or predominantly responsible for, the creation of the materials.

## Name segment for corporate bodies
**Single corporate body** see Rule 2.3.4.

**More than one corporate body**
**2.3.16.**  If the records of more than one corporate body are included in the materials, record only one name in the title.  Establish a consistent policy for selecting the name of the corporate body to be used in the title.  While the name of only one corporate body can be included in the title, names of other corporate bodies whose records are included in the materials may be recorded in the Name of Creator(s) Element as specified in rule 9.9.
