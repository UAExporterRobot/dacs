# 2.6  Name of Creator(s) Element


A description of the context in which the materials being described were created, assembled, accumulated, and/or maintained is as important as the description of the materials themselves.  One of the most significant aspects of establishing the context of creation is to identify the individual, family, or organization responsible for that process.  Depending on the materials being described, the archivist may express that relationship by various terms:  creator, author, collector, artist, cartographer, or, more generically, as the provenance of the materials.  Multiple individuals and organizations may serve multiple roles with respect to a given body of records.  For example, a published document might be filed with a regulatory agency.  The company that created a report would be its author, while the government body was responsible for assembling this report with others into a series of records.  Both played a role in the creation of the materials that have come to the repository.

Detailed rules in Part II, Chapter 9, Identifying Creators, specify which name(s) should be provided in the Name of Creator(s) Element to document the processes by which the records were created, assembled, accumulated, and/or maintained.  Specific systems may store information about creators either in the descriptions of records or separately in a linked authority file.  In addition, names of creators serve as access points (see Overview of Archival Description).
