# 4.5 Languages and Scripts of the Material (Required)

## Purpose and Scope
This element identifies the language(s), script(s), and symbol systems employed in the materials being described, particularly as they may affect its use.

*Commentary: While most repositories in the United States will provide descriptions in English, it is frequently the case that some or all of a body of archival material is in other languages.
Language and script information may also be represented as codes for machine processing using the appropriate ISO codes for languages (ISO 639-1 and ISO 639-2: Codes for the representation of names of languages) or scripts (ISO 15924: Codes for the representation of names of scripts).*
