### APPENDIX A

# GLOSSARY

This glossary contains definitions of most of the archival terms used in these rules with the exception of specialized terms that are defined in footnotes within a particular chapter.

## APPENDIX D

Full EAD and MARC 21 Examples

The following examples represent short finding aids, all multilevel descriptions and fully encoded using Encoded Archival Description, Version 2002 (EAD).  Following the finding aids are MARC 21 records for the same materials.  Examples are provided for:

Personal papers—Mildred Davenport Dance Programs and Dance School Materials.
Family papers—Bacot Family Papers.
Organizational records—Swine Influenza Immunization Program Records.
Collection—Herndon-Weik Collection of Lincolniana.

The presentation of these examples is intended only to assist in understanding how descriptive data, created according to DACS rules, can be encoded in EAD for online output.  The examples are not meant to be prescriptive and should not be used as a reference for encoding.  Archivists seeking more information on encoding should consult the Encoded Archival Description Tag Library, Version 2002 (see Appendix B).

In these examples, DACS element numbers are provided to the left of specific data elements whose content was formulated according to DACS rules.  DACS elements noted in Chapter 1 as minimum requirements for a multilevel description are indicated in bold in these examples.

At the highest level of description, the EAD examples use all of the “multilevel added value” elements from Chapter 1.  Subsequent levels of description in the finding aids (series, subseries, file, and item) use only “multilevel added value” elements from which information is not inherited from higher levels. At the lowest level of description in each of these examples, the DACS element numbers are only indicated until the pattern is established.

    <head>Biography</head>
    <p>Mildred Ellen Davenport was a noted civic official and military officer with an extensive career as a dancer and dance instructor in Boston in the 1930s and 1940s. She was born in Boston on November 12, 1900. She began her dance studies at C.C. Perkins Grade School and Prince School as a teenager, and graduated from Boston Girls' High School in 1918. In the 1920s she studied at the Sargent School for Physical Culture and at Harvard, and opened her first dance school, the Davenport School of Dance. Over the next ten years she studied under Ted Shawn and taught dance in Boston. She was also progressively more involved in road show performances such as Hot Chocolates. From 1930 to 1935 she performed in a number of African-American musical productions on Broadway, including Fast and Furious, Flying Colors, and Black Birds. In 1932 she established her second dance school, the Silver Box Studio, in the South End of Boston. She became the first African American woman to perform with the Arthur Fiedler Pops unit of the Boston Symphony Orchestra at this time.</p>
    <p>During World War II, Davenport enlisted in the Army as a captain. She produced musical shows for military bases and later served as a special service officer, library officer, and advisor in the Office of Racial Affairs. In 1950, she served as an executive board member for the N.A.A.C.P. office in Boston. From 1947 to 1968 she worked for the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination, founded in 1944 to enforce fair employment practices. Davenport died in Boston in 1990.</p>

<abstract label="Abstract">Bacot family members were cotton planters of Mars Bluff Plantation near Florence, Darlington District, S.C., and, beginning in 1865, partners in the Jarrot &amp; Bacot Drug Store in Florence. The Bacots were related to the Brockinton family and descended from South Carolina Huguenots. The collection includes correspondence, financial and legal materials, and other items of Bacot family members and their Brockinton family relatives. Correspondence chiefly relates to business dealings of Peter Samuel Bacot, who managed the plantation, and to family and social activities. Some letters are from cotton factors in Charleston, S.C. Also included are slave lists, and, after the Civil War, contracts relating to the employment of freedmen on the plantation; a few items relating to the Jarrot &amp; Bacot Drug Store; currency issued by South Carolina, 1775-1862; and typed transcriptions of articles published in 1826 about Huguenots in South Carolina.</abstract>

    <head>Biographical Note</head>
    <p>The Bacot family, descendants of South Carolina Huguenots and related to the Brockington family, owned the Mars Bluff Plantation near Florence in the Darlington District of South Carolina. They owned a considerable number of slaves and grew cotton and other cash crops on the plantation. Chief among the Bacots in the 1840s and 1850s was Peter Samuel Bacot, who appears to have been responsible for managing Mars Bluff. After the Civil War, the Bacots employed freedmen to work the plantation and entered into a partnership to open the Jarrot &amp; Bacot Drug Store in Florence.</p>

    <head>Collection Overview</head>
    <p>The collection includes correspondence, financial and legal materials, and other items relating to the Bacot family of Mars Bluff Plantation, Darlington District, S.C., and to their Brockinton relatives.  Many 1840s letters relating to family and social affairs are to Mary Brockington, who lived at Mars Bluff. Most of the letters, 1850s-1860s, relate to Peter Samuel Bacot's management of the plantation and include several from cotton factors in Charleston, S.C. Financial and legal materials from the 1850s include slave lists and, in 1866 and 1867, contracts and other materials relating to the employment of freedmen on the plantation. Other papers include examples of South Carolina currency, 1775-1862, and a typed transcription of <title render="doublequote">The French Refugees,</title> a series of articles about Huguenots in South Carolina, that appeared in the <title render="italic">City Gazette and Commercial Daily Advertiser</title> of Charleston in May 1826.</p>

    <p>Correspondence relating to Bacot family members and their relatives, friends, and business associates. Letters in the 1840s are chiefly to Mary H. Brockinton at Mars Bluff Plantation. They discuss social engagements and family affairs. Except for an invitation in 1850 and an exchange of letters in July 1855 between Peter Samuel Bacot and his son Richard at school, all letters in the 1850s relate to Peter Samuel Bacot's business accounts with cotton factors in Charleston, S.C. Several of the letters after 1865 relate to the Jarrot &amp; Bacot Drug Store in Florence, S.C. The 1887 item announces an event at the Ashley Phosphate Company in Charleston.</p>

These include contracts, 18 August 1866, that set out terms of employment and a 7 March 1867 medical services contract between the freedmen and a local physician. Most items in the 1870s and 1880s are routine bills and receipts for food and other purchases.</p>

<head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>Shortly after the death of Abraham Lincoln, William Henry Herndon began gathering material for a biography of his former law partner. In 1885, Jesse William Weik brought new inspiration and assistance to the endeavor, and in 1888 Herndon's biography was completed through their joint effort. This collection of Lincolniana is the product of their research. The material covers the time period circa 1824-1933 and is divided into six groups: I: Arithmetic Book and Scrapbooks; II: Correspondence of Lincoln; III: Legal Documents; IV: Papers of William Henry Herndon; V: Papers of Jesse William Weik; and VI: Miscellany.</p>
<p>Group I consists of one leaf (two pages) of an arithmetic book, into which Lincoln, as a young man, entered tables and exercises in linear measure, and two scrapbooks of newspaper clippings. One scrapbook contains editorials, news items, letters, and a number of statistical tables dealing with such subjects as demographics, slavery, geography, religion, railroads, agriculture, immigration, and monetary matters. Lincoln is alleged to have gathered the material for his debates with Stephen Arnold Douglas during their race for the United States Senate in 1858. The other scrapbook contains similar clippings and also includes material on the presidential election of 1860.</p>
<p>Group II, comprised largely of correspondence, is divided into three sections. Section A consists of twelve letters and a certificate of survey in Lincoln's hand. These items are listed as Nos. 3-14 and 770 in the inventory and include six letters from Lincoln to Mark William Delahay. Section B consists chiefly of reproductions of letters and papers written by Lincoln. Several letters from Lincoln to Joshua Speed document the friendship between the two men and their close communication on personal and public affairs. Other recipients include Joshua R. Giddings, Samuel Haycraft, John D. Johnston, Andrew McCallen, Leonard Swett, Richard S. Thomas, Henry Clay Whitney, and Archibald Williams. Letters to Lincoln from 1848 through 1861 and listed as Nos. 774-806 in the inventory constitute Section C of Group II. The campaign of 1856 is the subject of much of the correspondence. The candidates, Millard Fillmore, John C. Fremont, and James Buchanan; campaign strategy; and the strength of the Democratic, Republican, and Know-Nothing parties are among the topics discussed. The correspondents include John Bell, Joshua R. Giddings, Norman B. Judd, Thaddeus Stevens, John Wentworth, Richard Yates, and others. This section also contains newspaper clippings and miscellaneous printed material.</p>
<p>Group III comprises documents related to Lincoln's legal cases. It contains certificates, petitions, affidavits, notices, abstracts, writs, briefs, depositions, and other papers dealing with such subjects as divorce, slander, assault and battery, and usury. Most of this material is described as Nos. 15-773 and 2000-78 in the inventory.</p>
<p>The largest series in the collection, Group IV, consists of correspondence, interviews, recollections, notes, newspaper clippings, and other material of William Henry Herndon. Included are an interview with Mary Todd Lincoln in 1871, two long interviews with Dennis Hanks, letters from Hanks to Herndon written in 1865 and 1866 mainly on family history, letters to Herndon from Charles Friend on the Enlow story, and letters and notes from Herndon to Weik between 1881 October 1 and 1891 February 27 containing reminiscences of Lincoln's life.</p>
<p>Prominent in this series are Lincoln's family members, schoolmates, neighbors in New Salem and Springfield, Illinois, law partners, colleagues at the bar and in the Illinois legislature, political party allies, and White House associates. Representative names include Ninian Wirt Edwards (brother-in-law), Kate Roby Gentry (schoolmate), Mentor Graham (teacher), John Hay, whose letter of 1866 September 5 discusses Lincoln's daily life in the White House and ends with the statement that he was "the greatest character since Christ," John B. Helm (store clerk), Sarah Bush Johnston Lincoln (stepmother), Stephen T. Logan (law partner), Leonard Swett (lawyer), Frances Wallace (sister-in-law), and Robert L. Wilson (one of the "Long Nine," a group of tall Whigs, including Lincoln, who served together in the Illinois legislature). Also in Group IV are  manuscripts by Herndon bearing such titles as "Lincoln's Development," "Lincoln's Courtship with Miss Owens," "The Lincoln-Douglas Debates," "Miss Rutledge and Lincoln," and "Lincoln's Ways."</p>
<p>Group V, the papers of Jesse William Weik, consists of correspondence, notes, extracts, interviews, typed and handwritten copies of documents, and other items. Correspondents include Albert Jeremiah Beveridge, James Cook Conkling, Richard Henry Dana, John Hay, John G. Nicolay, Edward Lillie Pierce, Lyman Trumbull, and Horace White.</p>
<p>Group VI is an assortment of unbound material which includes photostatic copies and facsimiles of documents mostly by Lincoln, a printed sermon and speech by Theodore Parker, newspaper clippings, magazine articles, pamphlets, one chapter of Albert Jeremiah Beveridge's <title>Abraham Lincoln (1928),</title> Charles M. Thompson's report on the "Lincoln Way" investigation, records of the Weik Manuscript Corporation, and negative photographs of documents collected by Herndon and Weik. </p>

    <p>An annotated inventory describing each item in the collection, but in an order different from the current arrangement, and a negative photostatic copy of the inventory with fewer annotations may be found in the Manuscript Division Reading Room reference collection. Special card file indexes for the collection exist but are housed separately from the items themselves. A microfilm version of these indexes may be found on reel 15 of the Miscellany series.
