# Authority Records

## Purpose and Scope
The purpose of this chapter is to describe the elements of a fully documented archival authority record.  Because of the variety of ways in which this data might be stored and used, DACS prescribes only the elements of information that need to be recorded and not the precise formats in which they are stored or presented to users.

Commentary:  An authority record is a description of a personal, family, or corporate entity associated with a body of archival materials, typically where that name is used as an access point to a description of those records.  The International Standard Archival Authority Record for Corporate Bodies, Persons, and Families (ISAAR(CPF)) identifies the four types of information found in an archival authority record:

* the authoritative form of the name of the entity as established by cataloging rules such as those found in Chapters 12-14, along with references to any variant forms of that name by which researchers might know that entity,
* a description of the history and activities of the entity that are pertinent to the records with which it is associated, written in accordance with the rules in Chapter 10,
* references to related persons, families, and corporate bodies, and
* management information regarding the creation and status of the record which is of use to the archivist.

This chapter also describes the ways in which authority records may be linked to other resources such as descriptions of archival materials, or to other data about the entity such as biographical directories.

Authority information may be recorded and used in a variety of ways.  It may be available electronically as part of a publicly accessible information system linked to descriptions of archival materials (see the introduction to Part II).  This data may be presented to the user in a paper-based system of finding aids in the manner of traditional see and see also references in a card catalog, or it might be kept in a "shelf list" or official file strictly for internal staff control of the information, especially the form of headings.

While these rules address the formation of descriptions for persons, families, and corporate bodies associated with the creation and custody of archival materials (frequently referred to in the rules as “entities”), authority records may also be created to document entities that are the subject of materials in such records.  The same type of data is appropriate in either situation.

## Exclusions
**11.1.**  Record information about the relationships between descriptions of archival materials in the Related Materials Element (6.3).

**11.2.**  Record information about the relationships between levels of arrangement within a description in the System of Arrangement Element (3.2).

## Sources of Information
**11.3.**  Take the information from any reliable source.

## General Rule
**11.4.**  Create an authority record for each person, family, or corporate body associated with the creation of archival materials as specified in the rules in Chapter 9.

## Form of the Name
### Authorized Form
**11.5.**  Record the name of the entity being described in the authority record in the standardized form prescribed by Chapters 12-14.

`Haworth, Kent MacLean, 1946-`<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup>

`Stibbe, Hugo L. P.`

**11.6.**  Indicate by codes or text whether the entity named in the heading is a corporate body, a person, or a family.
```
100 3b  ‡a William Smith family
MARC 21 encoding indicating that the entry is a family name.

<corpname>Hal Leonard Publishing Corporation</corpname>
```
*EAD encoding indicating that the entry is a corporate body.*

### Parallel Forms of the Name
Commentary:  A parallel name is an alternative form of the authorized name for the same person, family, or corporate body, formulated in alternative languages (as when there are two or more official languages).  An institution may, as a matter of policy, choose to create separate authority records for each authorized form of the name, in which case the parallel form of the name would be treated as a related or variant name.  If, however, the institution or agency maintains records in only one language, the name in another language would be recorded as a parallel form of the authorized form of the name in a single authority record for that entity.

**11.7.**  If an institution maintains records in two or more official languages, record as a related name the form of the authorized name as it occurs in the other language(s).
```
National Library of Canada (authorized name)
Parallel name(s):  Bibliothèque nationale du Canada
```

**11.8.**  If the institution maintains records in only one language, record as a variant in the same authority record the parallel form of the authorized name as it occurs in the other language(s), as instructed in rule 11.10.
```
United Church of Canada (authorized name)
Variant name(s):  L'église unie du Canada
```

### Standardized form of the name according to other rules
**11.9.**  Record the name of the entity as it would be constructed according to the rules of other, for example earlier, cataloging conventions when the entity is represented as such in an existing catalog.
```
Minnesota.  Section on Wildlife
Pre-AACR2 form:  Minnesota.  Division of Fish and Wildlife.  Section on Wildlife
```
```
Washington National Cathedral
Pre-AACR2 form:  Washington, D.C.  Cathedral of Saint Peter and Saint Paul
```

### Other forms of names
**11.10.**  Record all other names or forms of name(s) that might reasonably be sought by a user, but were not chosen as the authorized form of name.
```
Clark, Joe (authorized name)
Variant name(s):    Clark, Charles Joseph
    Clark, C. J.

## Description of the Person, Family, or Corporate Body
**11.12.**  Describe the entity that is the subject of the authority record as prescribed in Chapter 10.
```
Hubert H. Humphrey was born in Wallace, South Dakota, on May 27, 1911.  He left South Dakota to attend the University of Minnesota but returned to South Dakota to help manage his father’s drug store early in the depression.  He attended the Capitol College of Pharmacy in Denver, Colorado, and became a register pharmacist in 1933.  On September 3, 1936, Humphrey married Muriel Fay Buck. He returned to the University of Minnesota and earned a B.A. degree in 1939.  In 1940 he earned an M.A. in political science from Louisiana State University and returned to Minneapolis to teach and pursue further graduate study, he began working for the W.P.A. (Works Progress Administration).  He moved on from there to a series of positions with wartime agencies.  In 1943, he ran unsuccessfully for Mayor of Minneapolis and returned to teaching as a visiting professor at Macalester College in St. Paul.  Between 1943 and 1945 Humphrey worked at a variety of jobs.  In 1945, he was elected Mayor of Minneapolis and served until 1948.  In 1948, at the Democratic National Convention, he gained national attention when he delivered a stirring speech in favor of a strong civil rights plank in the party’s platform.  In November of 1948, Humphrey was elected to the United States Senate.  He served as the Senate Democratic Whip from 1961 to 1964.

In 1964, at the Democratic National Convention, President Lyndon B. Johnson asked the convention to select Humphrey as the Vice Presidential nominee.  The ticket was elected in November in a Democratic landslide.  In 1968, Humphrey was the Democratic Party’s candidate for President, but he was defeated narrowly by Richard M. Nixon.  After the defeat, Humphrey returned to Minnesota to teach at the University of Minnesota and Macalester College.  He returned to the U.S. Senate in 1971, and he won re-election in 1976.  He died January 13, 1978 of cancer.

## Related Persons, Families, and Corporate Bodies
Commentary:  In describing the parties that created, assembled, accumulated, and/or maintained and used archival records, it will be useful to identify related persons, families, and organizations.  They may be connected in a variety of ways, such as members of families, hierarchical relationships between parts of organizations, chronological (i.e., predecessor/successor) relationships between organizations or parts of organizations, or offices held by a person within an organization.  Related names might also be used within a descriptive system as alternative access points to descriptions of archival records, or as links to other authority records.

**11.13.**  Record the authorized names and any relevant unique identifiers, including the authority record identifier, of corporate bodies, persons, or families that have a significant relationship with the entity named in the authority record.
```

```

**11.14.**  Briefly describe the nature of the relationship unless it is clearly indicated in the Administrative/Biographical History.

## Related Archival Materials and Other Resources
Commentary:  While authority records are created to document the context in which archival materials were created, it is also desirable to associate them with descriptions of the materials themselves and with other, external data that provides additional information about the entity described in the record.  These connections may be electronic links within an archival information system between the authority record and associated descriptions or links to external files such as online biographical databases.  They may also be recorded as citations in a print-based authority file.

### Identifiers and titles of related resources
**11.28.**  Provide the unique identifiers/reference codes or titles for the related resources necessary to establish a connection between the entity and the related resource.
