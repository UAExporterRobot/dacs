# 12.1 Names/Identifiers of Related Corporate Bodies, Persons, or Families

*Commentary: In describing the parties that created, assembled, accumulated, and/or maintained and used archival records, it will be useful to identify related persons, families, and organizations. They may be connected in a variety of ways, such as members of families, hierarchical relationships between parts of organizations, chronological (i.e., predecessor/successor) relationships between organizations or parts of organizations, or offices held by a person within an organization. Related names might also be used within a descriptive system as alternative access points to descriptions of archival records or as links to other authority records.*

12.1.1 Record the authorized names and any relevant unique identifiers, including the authority record identifier, of corporate bodies, persons, or families that have a significant relationship with the entity named in the authority record.
