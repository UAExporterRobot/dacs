# Identifying Creators

## Purpose and Scope
The purpose of this chapter is to identify the corporate bodies, persons, and families associated with the creation, assembly, accumulation, and/or maintenance and use of the materials being described so that they might be appropriately documented and used to create access points by which users can search for and retrieve descriptive records.  For archival materials, the creator is typically the corporate body, family, or person responsible for an entire body of materials.  However, a creator can also be responsible for the intellectual or artistic content of a single item, as in the writer of a letter or the painter of a portrait.  A collector of materials, for example, Vietnam War memorabilia, letters of presidents of the United States, or materials relating to suffragettes, is considered the creator of the collection.

Commentary:  Various relationships exist between records and the organizations or individuals associated with them.  The primary one is responsibility for the creation, assembly, accumulation, and/or maintenance and use of the materials being described.  Depending on the nature of those materials, one may express that relationship by various terms: author, collector, artist, cartographer, photographer, etc., or, more generically, as the provenance of the materials.  The archivist may also wish to identify entities who had custody of the records at some time (see 5.1).

This chapter provides rules for determining which entities need to be documented as creators.   The names selected in this process will also serve as access points—index terms by which users can search for and locate relevant archival materials.

The use of the names of creators as access points enables researchers to gain access to an institution's holdings, and provides a means of linking all records created by a particular person, family, or corporate body.  The selection of access points is discussed in the Overview of Archival Description.  The formation of nominal access points is discussed in Part III.

## Exclusions
**9.1.**  The rules for the consistent formation of names of persons, families, and corporate bodies identified as creators and chosen as access points are found in Chapters 12–14.

**9.2.**  The rules for documenting relationships between creating entities are found in Chapter 11.

## Sources of Information
**9.3.**  Take the information from the archival descriptions of the material as created according to the rules in Part I  and Chapter 10, <sub>[1](#footnote1)</sub> as instructed in the following rules.

## General Rules
**9.4.**  Record the name(s) of creators at all levels of description as specified in the following rules, except as restricted by 9.10 or in accordance with institutional policy.

**9.5.**  Record as access points only names that appear in the archival description to which they relate.

**9.6.**  If it is appropriate in the context of a particular descriptive system to record a name other than those prescribed in this chapter, do so.

**9.7.**  Where the institution maintains a separate system of authority files, create authority records for the authorized forms of the names of the persons, families, and corporate bodies that are identified as creators using the rules in Chapter 11.

## Identifying Creators
Commentary:  The source for the name of the creator is usually the name element in the supplied title (2.3.4-2.3.17).  In many cases there will be only one creator; however, when there is more than one, the archivist must sometimes look in other parts of the description to ensure that all creators are identified.  When describing the records of a person or family for which there are several creators, the supplied title may contain all the creators' names; however, the repository may also choose to include only one name in the title.  When supplying a title for the records of a corporate body, only one creator can be named in the title.  Other creators will be mentioned in the Administrative/Biographical History Element (Chapter 10), and recorded as access points.

**9.8.**  Record the name(s) of the creator(s) identified in the name element in the supplied title of the materials in the authorized form specified in Chapters 12-14.
