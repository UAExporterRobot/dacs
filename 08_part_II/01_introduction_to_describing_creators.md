# Introduction to Describing Creators

The structure and content of archival materials cannot be completely understood without some knowledge of the context in which they were created.  It is insufficient for the archivist simply to include the name of the creator in the title of the description of the materials.  Additional information is required regarding the persons, families, and corporate bodies responsible for the creation, assembly, accumulation, and/or maintenance and use of the archival materials being described.  Part II describes the information that is required to establish this context.  It is the logical outcome of Principle 8 in the Statement of Principles: that the creators of archival materials, as well as the materials themselves, must be described.

There are three steps in the process of creating the documentation that establishes archival context.

* The archivist must first identify the individuals, families, and corporate bodies that played a significant role in the creation of the materials.

Chapter 9, Identifying Creators, provides specific guidance as to which of these entities need to be associated with the description of the materials, based on their role in the creation, assembly, accumulation, and/or maintenance and use of the records.

* The archivist must assemble biographical information about these individuals and families or data about the history, structure, functions, and relationships of the relevant organization.

Chapter 10 provides guidance on recording biographical data or administrative histories.

* Finally, the names of these entities must be rendered in a standardized form to facilitate the retrieval of information across descriptions, systems, and institutions.

Three chapters in Part III cover the construction of the proper form of names, based on AACR2.   Chapter 12 covers personal and family names, Chapter 14 addresses corporate names, and Chapter 13 provides rules for geographic entities that serve as the names of corporate bodies.

Once formulated, this information may be presented to the user in either of two ways. Traditionally, archivists have incorporated the names of creators and contextual information about them directly into archival descriptions, both in catalog records and in finding aids.  Such information, created according to the rules in DACS, may certainly continue to be employed in this manner.

However, DACS also provides an alternative:  information about creators of archival materials can be captured and maintained in a separate system of archival authority records that are linked to the archival descriptions rather than being embedded within them.  This approach reflects the model created by the International Council on Archives where the General International Standard for Archival Description (ISAD(G)) provides rules on description and the International Standard Archival Authority Record for Corporate Bodies, Persons and Families (ISAAR(CPF)) governs the creation of information about creators.  Chapter 11 provides guidance on the construction of archival authority records based on the structure of ISAAR(CPF).

Separating the capture and maintenance of contextual information has a number of advantages.  The ability to link a description of a creating entity to several descriptions of records from the same creator held within the same repository eliminates the need to duplicate the administrative/biographical history in each description.  Furthermore, the practice enables the linking of descriptions of creating entities to descriptions of records from the same creator(s) held by more than one repository, as well as to descriptions of related library and museum materials, Web sites, etc.  Relationships between creating entities also can be documented in authority records.  Finally, certain functions can be efficiently performed in authority records, such as maintaining a record of variant and related terms, which cannot be done well (or at all) within descriptions.

Where several repositories hold records of the same provenance, they can share or exchange contextual information about the creator more easily if it has been maintained in a standardized manner.  Archival authority records do not merely record contextual information, they also provide a means of standardizing access points and the contextual information.  They are similar to library authority records in that both support the creation of standardized access points in descriptions.  Such standardization has two aspects:  consistency and uniqueness.  Consistency requires that the name of a creator be identical each time it is used as an access point in the descriptive system.  This is achieved by implementing rules that establish an authorized form of the name where different forms exist.  Uniqueness requires that each person, family, or corporate body have a heading that applies to it alone.  This is achieved by making additions to otherwise identical names in order to distinguish between them.  Rules for achieving this consistency are provided in Part III.  Whenever possible, repositories should use the form of personal and corporate names found in the Library of Congress Authorities (formerly Library of Congress Name Authority File (LCNAF)).<sub>[1](#footnote1)</sub>

While archival authority records and the bibliographic authority records used in library systems are similar, they differ in significant ways.  A bibliographic authority record consists of an authorized heading that standardizes the form of the name, as well as other information elements that describe the named entity or point to other authority records.  Archival authority records contain the following elements similar to bibliographic authority records:

the authority entry (i.e., a standardized access point established by an archival agency uniquely identifying the corporate body, person, or family associated with the creation of the archival materials);
references to related names and variant names; and
documentation of how the authority record was established and maintained.

Beyond this, archival authority records support a much wider set of requirements than library authority records.  These additional requirements derive from the importance of documenting the context of records creation in archival description and control systems.  As such, archival authority records usually contain much more information than library authority records.

While archival authority records generally are distinguished from library authority records in that they focus on identifying and providing information about those associated in some way with the creation of archival materials, they do not include topical subjects, forms or genres, functions, or uniform titles.  Archivists may also maintain authority files to control the terms used to provide access in these ways, however, such applications are beyond the scope of this standard. <sub>[2](#footnote2)</sub>

The two methods of presenting archival context information, i.e., within the description or in a separate authority file, are not mutually exclusive.  Indeed, archives may quite reasonably maintain separate files of authority data for internal control purposes even when the names reflected in those records are embedded in descriptions.

## Purpose and Scope
Part II provides rules for documenting the context in which archival materials were created, and, in Chapter 11, guidance on the creation of authority records based on the data elements found in ISAAR(CPF).

## Exclusions
Instructions for describing the archival materials themselves are found in Part I.

Instructions for formatting names of persons, families, or corporate bodies identified as creators using the rules in Chapter 9 are found in Part III.

## Structure and Numbering
Part II consists of three chapters.  Two of the chapters provide content rules for elements defined in Part I:  Chapter 9 contains the rules for the Name of Creator(s) Element (2.6), and Chapter 10 contains rules for the Administrative/Biographical History Element (2.7).  Chapter 11 provides rules for creating authority records for repositories that wish to maintain separate authority systems.

## Descriptive Outputs
The rules provide for data input, but do not prescribe particular outputs or display.  Presentation of this information to the user, including the way that the authority information is linked with the descriptions of the materials, will be determined by institutional policy within each repository’s descriptive system.

## Examples
The examples in Part II are illustrative, not prescriptive.  They illustrate only the application of the rule to which they are appended.  Furthermore, the presentation of the examples is intended only to assist in understanding how to use the rules and does not imply a prescribed layout, typography, or output.  Some examples include citations for the body of archival materials from which they were drawn to help clarify the application of the rule to a particular level of description.

While the rules themselves are output neutral, examples are encoded in EAD and
MARC 21, two widely used output mechanisms for archival descriptions, at the end of Chapters 9 and 10.  The EAD examples may include attributes within elements.  These are intended to illustrate aspects of the rules, and do not indicate that a specific attribute is required.  The MARC 21 examples include a blank space before and after each subfield for the sake of clarity.  The fields that do not consist of standardized codes have a subfield a (‡a) at the beginning.  Some systems require that ‡a be made explicit; others assume the ‡a is always the first subfield.  Where MARC two-position field indicators are not required or are not defined, a “b” (blank) is given in their place.

<a name="footnote2">[2]</a> DACS does not provide rules for the construction and maintenance of subject authorities.  However, a corporate body, person, or family can also be the subject of a unit of description, and an archival authority record that conforms to DACS may also serve to control the form of name and identity of a corporate body, person, or family named in a subject access point.
