# Preface

The Society of American Archivists adopted Describing Archives: A Content Standard (DACS) as the official content standard of the U.S. archival community in 2005. DACS was designed to be used to create a variety of archival descriptions, including finding aids and catalog records. It replaced Archives, Personal Papers, and Manuscripts, <sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup> which had served the U.S. archival community for more than two decades.

## Relationship to Other Standards
DACS is related to other standards. Descriptions created according to DACS are shared
electronically using encoding standards, such as MAchine-Readable Cataloging (MARC
21), Encoded Archival Description (EAD), and Encoded Archival Context (EAC). There
are also close connections with Resource Description and Access (RDA) and with
standards promulgated by the International Council on Archives (ICA), including
International Standard Archival Description—General (ISAD[G]), the International
Standard Archival Authority Record for Corporate Bodies, Persons, and Families
(ISAAR[CPF]), and the International Standard for Describing Functions (ISDF).
In particular, DACS largely conforms to the standards created by the ICA: ISAD(G) and
ISAAR(CPF). All of the data elements of ISAD(G) and ISAAR(CPF) are incorporated
into DACS—in some cases, virtually word for word. The exception is the exclusion of
the Level of Description element from ISAD(G). It is hoped that these close ties will
allow U.S. archivists to readily share information about their collections around the
world. This revision continues to rely heavily on the ICA standards while recognizing
that there is a growing convergence between museum, library, and archival practice.

This growing convergence and the removal of a glossary from DACS make it important
to carefully define the entities described in DACS. Here, the following terms rely on the
definitions shown:
Corporate body: an organization or group of people identified by a name and that acts,
or may act, as a unit, or an institutional position held by a person
Person: an individual of the human species
Family: two or more people related through marriage, birth, adoption, or other legal
manner, or who present themselves as a family
These definitions disallow the creation of headings for personas, bibliographic identities,
and animals but otherwise would not create significant divergence from library authority
file structures.

## Revision Decisions
As a descriptive standard of the Society of American Archivists, DACS was placed on a
periodic revision cycle. With the release of Resource Description and Access (RDA)<sup>[2](#footnote2)</sup> in
2010, the Council of the Society of American Archivists asked the Technical
Subcommittee on Describing Archives: A Content Standard (TS-DACS) to initiate a
revision of DACS. TS-DACS was asked to pay particular attention to how DACS and
RDA could be brought into closer alignment. TS-DACS was also charged with looking at
the relationship between DACS and the archival standards developed by the International
Council on Archives.

In the fall of 2010, TS-DACS began soliciting feedback from the U.S. archival
community about how DACS could better meet the needs of that community.
Subcommittee members carefully reviewed that feedback and prioritized the
recommended changes. Early on, it was recognized that one of the most important issues
for the revision was to confront the growing convergence between archival, museum, and
library descriptive standards—particularly the promulgation and adoption of RDA.
Another significant issue was the need to align DACS with the descriptive standards
developed and supported by the International Council on Archives. A final issue was the
development of Encoded Archival Context and the Society of American Archivists’
adoption of it as an encoding standard and the need to provide guidance on the creation of
archival authority records.

### Resource Description and Access (RDA)
A careful review of the descriptive rules in DACS and comparison with the descriptive
rules contained in RDA quickly demonstrated that many of the rules in Part III of DACS
had been superseded by RDA and that important archival rules (particularly those related
to the creation of family names) had been included in RDA. This led to the most obvious
change from DACS 2004—the removal of Part III.

RDA rules for titles provided by archivists (“devised titles”) were in closer agreement
with archival practices. DACS 2004 had used the term supplied for these titles, in
alignment with ISAD(G). Recognizing the growing convergence between library,
museum, and archival descriptive standards, and the predominant use of the term devised
by companion archival standards to DACS, as well as the greater clarity of the term, the
subcommittee has chosen to change the term supplied to devised.

Finally, the subcommittee considers it important that the U.S. archival community
continue to monitor the development of RDA. Its reliance on entities and their linkages
provides promise for informing the developing archival conceptual model and for greater
cooperation between archives and libraries in the future.

### Standards of the International Council on Archives

Part I of DACS was initially developed to mirror the components of the General
International Standard Archival Description (ISAD[G]) developed by the International
Council on Archives (ICA). Part II was designed to mirror the International Standard
Archival Authority Record For Corporate Bodies, Persons and Families (ISAAR[CPF]).
This structure and concordance is maintained in the revised version of DACS.
ICA has also developed standards for describing functions (International Standard for
Describing Functions [ISDF]) and archival institutions (International Standard for
Describing Institutions with Archival Holdings [ISDIAH]). These standards are not
currently addressed by DACS.

ICA is currently in the process of developing “a single reference model for descriptive
standards to enable archivists to describe different types of archival entities (archival
materials, corporate bodies, persons, or families, and functions) and to document these
entities in relationship to each other at particular points of time, or over time.”<sup>[3](#footnote3)</sup> The
purpose of this reference model is to bring the ICA descriptive standards into closer
alignment with one another. The current revision of DACS recognizes the convergence of
descriptive standards, and TS-DACS will continue to monitor developments in this area
with the goal of keeping DACS aligned with ICA descriptive standards.

### Encoded Archival Context and the Need for a Content Standard for Archival Authority Records

The review of the ICA descriptive standards and the development and adoption of the
Encoded Archival Context encoding standard by the Society of American Archivists led
TS-DACS to heavily revise Part II of DACS. Part II of DACS has been reworked to
contain rules for the creation of archival authority records. Part II is broken into six
chapters to align with ISAAR(CPF).

The decision to make Part II into rules for archival authority records also necessitated
moving Chapters 9 (Identifying Creators) and 10 (Administrative/Biographical History)
into Part I as elements 2.6 and 2.7. Element 2.7 has been refocused on information
necessary for understanding the collection in hand.

### Digital Records
Perhaps the single area that received the most comments from community members was
the need to make DACS more relevant to modern records, which increasingly include or
consist exclusively of born-digital formats. Of particular concern were rules prescribing
papers, records, and collections as the collective terms describing the nature of the
archival unit. Commenters felt that these terms did not adequately convey the
increasingly digital format of the records. However, there was no community consensus
as to what terms should be used instead. Subcommittee members considered this issue in
depth and decided to revise the corresponding rule in DACS to permit local practices for
new collective terms (such as personal archives or personal records). TS-DACS
recommends that this issue be readdressed during the next revision of DACS.
In response to community members’ requests for electronic records examples in DACS, a
few such examples were added to Part I. These examples are meant to be illustrative of a
growing presence of digital records in archival collections. They will be more widely
represented on the companion website to DACS, which is described below.

### Examples
Another recurring theme in the community feedback was the desire for more examples to
be included in DACS. The subcommittee agreed that extensive and varied examples
would be a valuable help in using DACS. However, several factors pushed the
subcommittee’s response in a different direction. The DACS revision cycle is coinciding
with that for EAD; MARC is undergoing revisions as a result of RDA implementation
and will eventually be replaced; and EAC-CPF examples are just now becoming widely
available. The subcommittee decided that the best way to respond to the desire for more
examples would be to create a companion website to DACS where community members
could submit examples and best practices. It was decided to move the encoding examples
to this website as well. This will allow TS-DACS to respond more rapidly to changes in
encoding standards and to keep these examples current and up to date. The print edition
of DACS retains text examples illustrating specific rules, and additional examples have
been supplied as needed.

## Comparison to DACS 2004
Those accustomed to using DACS 2004 will have little difficulty continuing to utilize the
revised DACS. DACS is now divided into two parts: Part I, Describing Archival
Materials, and Part II, Archival Authority Records. The numbering schema from DACS
2004 has remained unchanged in Part I and a similar numbering schema has been
developed for the revised Part II.
