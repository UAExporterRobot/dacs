# Form of Names for Persons and Families

Commentary:  Once a personal or family name has been chosen for recording in a Name of Creator(s) Element, for inclusion in an archival authority record, or as a nominal access point, the form of that name must be standardized.  The purpose of this chapter is to provide rules for the standardized form of the names of persons and families.  Regularization of names is critical to the formulation of consistent citations to archival materials and, particularly in online environments, to the retrieval of all relevant records.  Therefore it is important for archivists to use the authority form of a name, if one exists, from the Library of Congress Authorities.<sub>[1](#footnote1)</sub>  If there is no authorized form in the Name Authority File, the rules in this chapter should be applied.  Other sources of information to be used in particular circumstances are indicated at various places within the rules themselves.  When a rule in this chapter contains an instruction to make a reference, do so in accordance with the rules in section 11.1.

In the examples in this chapter, variant names (i.e., names that are not authorized names or forms of the name) are indicated by the letter x in front of them.  This means that the variant name would be included in an authority record as instructed in Chapter 11.

For the most part, the numbering system in Chapter 12 follows that of Chapter 22 of AACR2, except that the DACS chapter number is substituted for AACR2 chapter number.  Rule 22.16A3 in AACR2, for example, is 12.16A3 in DACS.  The most significant difference between Chapter 22 of AACR2 and Chapter 12 of DACS is the addition of rules for forming the names of families.  These rules have been numbered 12.29, picking up where AACR2 stops.

## Choice of Name
**12.1.**  General Rules
**12.1A**  In general, choose, as the basis of the heading for a person, the name by which he or she is commonly known.  This may be the person’s real name, pseudonym, title of nobility, nickname, initials, or other appellation.  Treat a roman numeral associated with a given name (as, for example, in the case of some popes, royalty, and ecclesiastics) as part of the name.  For the treatment of the names of persons using one or more pseudonyms or a real name and one or more pseudonyms, see 12.2B.  For the form of names used in headings, see 12.4–12.16.

**12.1B.** Determine the name by which a person is commonly known from the following sources and in the order of preference given:

a) the name that appears most frequently in the person’s published works (if any);
b) the name that appears most frequently in the archival materials being described;
c) the name that appears in reference sources; <sub>[2](#footnote2)</sub>
d) the latest name.

If the name does not appear on a prescribed source of information (e.g., a photographer’s papers that consists only of unsigned photographs) determine the name by which he or she is known from reference sources issued in his or her language or country of residence or activity.

**12.1C.**   Include any titles of nobility or terms of honor (see also 12.12) or words or phrases (see also 12.8 and 12.16) that commonly appear either wholly or in part in association with names that do not include a surname.  Omit such titles, terms, words, or phrases from any name that does include a surname (see also 12.5 and 12.15) unless the name consists only of a surname (see 12.15A) or the name is of a married woman identified only by her husband’s name and a term of address (see 12.15B1).  Include all terms of rank in headings for nobles when the term commonly appears with the name in works by the person or in reference sources (see 12.6 and 12.12).  If an apparent addition to a name including a surname is in fact an intrinsic part of the name, as determined from reference sources or from works by or about that person, include the title.  For the treatment of other terms appearing in association with the name, see 12.19B.

```

**12.2.**  Choice among Different Names
**12.2A**  Predominant Name
**12.2A1.**  If a person (other than one using a pseudonym or pseudonyms, see 12.2B) is known by more than one name, choose the name by which the person is clearly most commonly known, if there is one.  Otherwise, choose one name or form of name according to the following order of preference:

a)    the name that appears most frequently in the person’s published works (if any);
b)    the name that appears most frequently in the archival materials being described;
c)    the name that appears in reference sources; <sub>[3](#footnote3)</sub>
d)    the latest name.

If a person’s name shows a nickname in quotation marks or within parentheses as a part of other forename(s), omit the nickname in formulating the heading.

    Name used:    Martin (Bud) Schulman
    Heading:    Schulman, Martin

If a married woman’s name shows her own forenames in parentheses as part of her married name, omit the parenthesized elements in formulating the heading.

    Name used:    Mrs. John A. (Edna I.) Spies
    Heading:    Spies, John A., Mrs.

**12.2B.**  Pseudonyms
A pseudonym is defined as “a name assumed by a personal author<sub>[4](#footnote4)</sub> to conceal or obscure his or her identity.”  Apply these rules only if a person has published or distributed works under a pseudonym.  Otherwise choose the person's real name.

**12.2B1.**  One Pseudonym.  If all the works or records of one person are identified only by a pseudonym, choose the pseudonym.  If the real name is known, make a reference from the real name to the pseudonym.  For the treatment of a pseudonym used jointly by two or more persons, see rule 21.6D in AACR2.

**12.2B2.**  Separate Identities.  If a person has established two or more identities, as indicated by the fact that works or records of one type appear under one pseudonym, and works or records of other types appear under the person’s real name or other pseudonyms, choose, as the basis for the heading for each group of works or records, the name by which those works or records are identified.  Make references to connect the names.  In case of doubt, do not consider a person to have separate identities.  For contemporary authors, see also 12.2B3.

If, in the works of contemporary authors, different names appear in different editions or versions of the same work or two or more names appear in one edition or version, choose, for all editions or versions, the name most frequently used in editions or versions of the work.  If that cannot be determined readily, choose the name appearing in the latest available edition or version of the work.  Make name-title references from the other name or names.

**12.2B4.**  If a person using more than one pseudonym, or his or her real name and one or more pseudonyms, but the use of the pseudonym(s) is not consistent enough for the creator to be clearly known by any of them (i.e., the person has neither established separate identities (see 12.2B2), nor is a contemporary author (see 12.2B3)), choose, as the basis for the heading, the person’s real name.  Make references from other names.

**12.2C.**  Change of Name
**12.2C1.**  If a person (other than one using a pseudonym or pseudonyms) has changed his or her name, choose the latest name or form of name unless there is reason to believe that an earlier name will persist as the name by which the person is better known.  Follow the same rule for a person who has acquired and become known by a title of nobility (see also 12.6).  As required, make references from the other form(s).

b)    the name that appears most frequently in the archival materials being described;
c)    the name that appears in reference sources; <sub>[5](#footnote5)</sub>

**12.3B.**  Language
**12.3B1.**  People Using More than One Language.  If the name of a person who has used more than one language appears in different language forms in his or her works, in reference sources, in his or her papers, in administrative acquisition records, or in other archival records, choose the form according to the following order of preference:

a)    the form corresponding to the language of most of that person’s published work (if any);

c)    the form that appears most frequently in reference sources.

**12.3B2.**  Names in Vernacular and Greek or Latin Forms.  If a name occurs in reference sources or in the person’s works, in his or her papers, in administrative acquisition records, or in other archival records, in a Greek or Latin form as well as in a form in the person’s vernacular, choose the form most commonly found in reference sources.
```
Sixt Birck
not    Xystus Betulius
```
```
Hugo Grotius
not    Hugo de Groot
```

In case of doubt, choose the Latin or Greek form for persons who were active before, or mostly before, A.D. 1400.  For persons active after that date, choose the vernacular form.
```
Giovanni da Imola
not    Joannes de Imola
(Died 1436)
```

```
Raghunātha Sūri
not    Irakunātasūri
(Wrote primarily in Sanskrit but also in Tamil)
```
In case of doubt as to which of two or more languages written in the Arabic script should be used for the romanization, base the choice on the nationality of the person or the language of the area of residence or activity.  If these criteria do not apply, choose (in this order of preference): Urdu, Arabic, Persian, any other language.

**12.3D.**  Spelling
**12.3D1.**  If variant spellings of a person’s name are found and these variations are not the result of different romanizations, choose the form resulting from an official change in orthography, or, if this does not apply, choose the predominant spelling.  In case of doubt, choose the spelling that seems most appropriate.  For spelling differences resulting from different romanizations, see 11.3C.

## Entry Element
**12.4.**  General Rules
**12.4A.**  If a person’s name (chosen according to 12.1–12.3) consists of several parts, select as the entry element that part of the name under which the person would normally be listed in authoritative alphabetic lists<sub>[8](#footnote8)</sub> in his or her language or country of residence or activity.

If, however, a person’s preference is known to be different from the normal usage, follow that preference in selecting the entry element.

**12.4B4.**  If the entry element is the proper name in a title of nobility (see 12.6), follow it by the personal name in direct order and then by the part of the title denoting rank.  Precede the personal name and the part of the title denoting rank by commas.

**12.5C2.**  Preferred or Established Form Known.  Enter a name containing a compound surname under the element by which the person bearing the name prefers to be entered. <sub>[11](#footnote11)</sub> If this is unknown, enter the name under the element under which it is listed in reference sources in the person's language or country of residence or activity.<sub>[12](#footnote12)</sub>

**12.5D.**  Surnames with Separately Written Prefixes
**12.5D1.**  Articles and Prepositions.  If a surname includes an article or preposition or combination of the two, enter under the element most commonly used as entry element in alphabetically arranged directories or other resources in the person’s language or country of residence or activity.  The rules listed under languages and language groups below summarize entry element practice.

If such a name is listed in a nonstandard fashion in reference sources in the person’s language or country of residence, enter under the entry element used in those sources.

If a person has used two or more languages, enter the name according to the language used in most of that person’s published works, in the materials being described, or in reference sources (in that order of preference).  In case of doubt, follow the rules for English if English is one of the languages.  Otherwise, if the person is known to have changed his or her country of residence, follow the rules for the language of the adopted country.

For more detailed treatment of names in other languages, see the IFLA UBCIM Programme’s survey of personal names.<sub>[19](#footnote19)</sub>

12.22-12.28 DACS does not have rules that correspond to 22.22-22.28 in AACR2, but the corresponding numbers (12.22-12.28) have been included as place-holders.  The DACS rule for family names, which has no equivalent in AACR2, has been given the next consecutive number, 12.29.

### Family Names
**12.29A.**  General Rule
The heading for a family consists of the family surname followed by the term “family.”<sub>[20](#footnote20)</sub>

**12.29B.**  Entry Element
In general, choose as the basis of the heading for a family, the name by which it is commonly known.

c)    the latest name;
d)    the name that appears in reference sources. <sub>[21](#footnote21)</sub>

If the name does not appear on a prescribed source of information, determine the name by which the family is known from reference sources issued in its language or country of residence or activity.

<a name="footnote12">[12]</a>: Disregard reference sources that list compound surnames in a uniform style regardless of preference or customary usage.

<a name="footnote13">[13]</a>: Disregard reference sources that list members of the nobility either all under title or all under surname.

<a name="footnote14">[14]</a>: The terms of rank in the Great Britain peerage are duke, duchess, marquess (marquis), marchioness, earl, countess, viscount, viscountess, baron, and baroness.  The heir of a British peer above the rank of baron usually takes the next to highest title of the peer during the peer's lifetime.

<a name="footnote15">[15]</a>: Great Britain peers (other than dukes and duchesses) usually use the terms of address Lord or Lady in place of their titles.  For example, George Gordon, Baron Byron, is almost invariably referred to as Lord Byron.

<a name="footnote16">[16]</a>: Disregard, in this context, reference sources dealing with the nobility.

<a name="footnote17">[17]</a>:Persons with such highest status are kings and queens, persons of imperial rank (emperors and empresses), and persons with other titles that denote such a status within a state or a people (grand-dukes, grand-duchesses, princes, princesses, etc.).  Rank is the only determining factor in applying these rules, not the degree of authority or power wielded by the person.
