# Form of Geographic Names

Commentary:  The purpose of this chapter is to provide rules for the standardized form of the names of geographic entities that may also be the name of corporate bodies.  The sources of information are indicated within the rules themselves.

For the most part, the numbering system in Chapter 13 follows that of Chapter 23 of AACR2, except that the DACS chapter number is substituted for AACR2 chapter number; for example, rule 23.174F2 in AACR2 is 13.174F2 in DACS.  There are no significant differences between the numbering of Chapter 23 of AACR2 and Chapter 13 of DACS.

**13.1.**  Introductory Note
**13.1A.**  The names of geographic entities (referred to throughout this chapter as places) are used to distinguish between corporate bodies with the same name (see 14.4C); as additions to other corporate names (e.g., conference names, see 14.7B4); and, commonly, as the names of governments (see 14.3E) and communities that are not governments.<sub>[1](#footnote1)</sub>

**13.2.**  General Rules
**13.2A.**  English Form
**13.2A1.**  Use the English form of the name of a place if there is one in general use.  Determine this from gazetteers and other reference sources published in English-speaking countries.  In case of doubt, use the vernacular form (see 13.2B).
```
Austria
not    Österreich

Copenhagen
not    København

Florence
not    Firenze

Ghent
not    Gent
not    Gand

```
If the English form of the name of a place is the English name of the government that has jurisdiction over the place, use that form.

**13.2B.**  Vernacular Form
**13.2B1.**  Use the form in the official language of the country if there is no English form in general use.
```
Buenos Aires

Gorlovka

Tallinn

Livorno

If the country has more than one official language, use the form most commonly found in English-language sources.

not    Helsingfors

**13.3.**  Changes of Name
**13.3A.**  If the name of a place changes, use as many of the names as are required by
1)    the rules on government names (14.3E) (e.g., Nyasaland or Malawi, as appropriate);
or    2)    the rules on additions to corporate names (14.4C4) and conference names (14.7B4) (e.g.  use Léopoldville or Kinshasa, as appropriate);
or    3)    other relevant rules in Chapter 14.

**13.4.**  Additions
**13.4A.**  Punctuation
**13.4A1.**  Make all additions to place names used as entry elements (see 14.3E) in parentheses.
