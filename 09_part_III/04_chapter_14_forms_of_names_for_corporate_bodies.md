# Form of  Names for Corporate Bodies

Commentary: Once the name of a corporate body has been chosen as an access point, the form of the name must be standardized.  The purpose of this chapter is to provide rules for the standardized form of the names of corporate bodies.  Standardization of corporate names, particularly in online environments, is critical to the retrieval of all relevant materials.  Therefore it is important for archivists to use the authority form of a name, if one exists, from the Library of Congress Authorities (LCNAF). <sub>[1](#footnote1)</sub> If there is no authorized form in the Name Authority File, the rules in this chapter should be applied.  The sources of information to be used in particular circumstances are indicated at various places within the rules themselves.  Where a rule in this chapter contains an instruction to make a reference, do so in accordance with the rules in section 11.1.

In the examples in this chapter, variant names (i.e., names that are not authorized names or forms of the name) are indicated by the letter x in front of them.  This means that the variant name would be included in an authority record as instructed in Chapter 11.

For the most part, the numbering system in Chapter 14 follows that of Chapter 24 of AACR2, except that the DACS chapter number is substituted for AACR2 chapter number; for example, Rule 24.13A in AACR2 is 14.13A in DACS.  Where the rules in DACS are different, as in the expanded rules for the treatment of variant names of corporate bodies (14.2B–14.2E), the numbering has been slightly adjusted.

**14.1.**  General Rule
**14.1A.**  Enter a corporate body <sub>[2](#footnote2)</sub> directly under the name by which it is identified, except when the rules that follow provide for entering it under the name of a higher or related body (see 14.13) or under the name of a government (see 14.18).

Determine the name by which a corporate body is identified from the following sources and in the order of preference given:

the name that appears in published items issued by the corporate body in its language (see also 14.3A);
the name that appears in reference sources; <sub>[3](#footnote3)</sub>
the name that appears in the corporate body's records;
the name that appears in administrative records relating to the acquisition of the materials being described;
the name that appears in other archival records.

If the name of a corporate body consists of or contains initials, omit or include periods and other marks of punctuation according to the predominant usage of the body.  In case of doubt, omit the periods, etc.  Do not leave a space between such punctuation and a following initial.  Do not leave spaces between the letters of an initialism written without periods, etc.  Make references from other forms of the name of a corporate body as instructed in section 11.1.

**14.1B.**  Romanization <sub>[5](#footnote5)</sub>

**14.1C.** Changes of Name
**14.1C1.**  If the name of a corporate body has changed (including a change from one language to another), establish an authorized form of the name to be used in the title in accordance with rule 2.3.17 and consider other names to be variant names (see 11.1B2–B4, 11.B16–B17).

**14.1C2.**  Records of More than One Corporate Body within the Same Unit Being Described.  If the records of more than one corporate body are included in the unit being described, establish a heading for each corporate body and record their relationships as instructed in rules 11.1B5–11.1B10.

**14.2.**  Variant Forms<sub>[7](#footnote7)</sub> of Names:  General Rules
**14.2A.**  Apply the following rules if variant forms of names for a corporate body appear or are used in the following sources respectively:  published items issued by it, reference sources, or the records.  Also apply the special rules in **14.3** when they are appropriate.

**14.2B.**  Variant Forms of Names Found in Published Sources
**14.2B1.**  If variant forms of the name are found in published items issued by the corporate body, use the name as it appears in the chief source of information <sub>[8](#footnote8)</sub> as opposed to forms found elsewhere in the items.

**14.2B2.**  If variant forms of the name appear in the chief sources of information for published items, use the name that is presented formally as indicated by layout or typography.  If no name is presented formally, or if all names are presented formally, use the predominant form of name.

If there is no predominant form, use a brief form (including an initialism or an acronym) that would differentiate the corporate body from others with the same or similar brief names.

records of administrative regulations (e.g., executive orders, constitutions, by-laws);
other records of policy (e.g., minutes, policy and procedures manuals).

**14.2D2.**  If the corporate body’s records do not include materials that fall into the categories listed above, use the form of name that appears most frequently in other materials in the records.

**14.2E.**  Variant Spellings
If variant spellings of the name are found, use the form resulting from an official change in orthography or, if this does not apply, use the predominant spelling.  In case of doubt, use the spelling that seems most appropriate.

**14.3**  Variant Forms of Names:  Special Rules

**14.3B.**  Language: International Bodies
**14.3B1.**  If the name of an international corporate body appears in English in published items issued by the body, in reference sources, or in its records (in that order of preference), use the English form.  In other cases, follow the instructions in 14.3A.

<a name="footnote3">[3]</a>: Reference sources, as used in this chapter, include official publications such as gazettes, registers, statutes, orders, regulations and, also, books and articles written about the corporate body.

<a name="footnote5">[5]</a>: Alternative rule.  Romanization.  If the name of the body is in a language written in a nonroman script and a romanized form appears in published items issued by the body or in its records, use that romanized form.  Refer as necessary from other romanizations.  If more than one romanized form is found, use the form resulting from romanization according to the table adopted by the institution for the language.

<a name="footnote6">[6]</a>: Systematic romanizations used in the examples in this chapter follow the tables (published by the Library of Congress in Cataloging Service, bulletin 118) adopted jointly by the American Library Association, the Canadian Library Association, and the Library of Congress.

<a name="footnote7">[7]</a>: Variant forms of names do not include names that result from a name change.  For these, see 14.1C.

<a name="footnote8">[8]</a>: For published items, the chief source of information is the title page or its equivalent.


<a name="footnote9">[9]</a>: Institutions should establish a policy for determining the form of name to be used when variant forms of names are found in reference sources.

<a name="footnote11">[11]</a>: Apply this rule, for example, to religious bodies, fraternal and knightly orders, church councils, and diplomatic conferences.  If it is necessary to establish a heading for a diplomatic conference that has no formal name and has not yet acquired a conventional name, use the name found most commonly in periodical articles and newspaper accounts in English.  If another name becomes established later, change the heading to that name.

<a name="footnote12">[12]</a>: Government is used here to mean the totality of corporate bodies (executive, legislative, and judicial) exercising the powers of a jurisdiction.  Treat as a government agency a corporate body known as government, or its equivalent in other languages, or a term with similar meaning, that is an executive element of a particular jurisdiction (see 14.18).


<a name="footnote13">[13]</a>: Distinguish cases in which the subordinate body's name includes the names of higher bodies from cases in which the names of higher bodies appear only in association with the subordinate body's name.
