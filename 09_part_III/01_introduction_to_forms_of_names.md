# Introduction to Forms of Names

## Purpose and Scope
Part III provides information about creating standardized forms for the names of persons, families, or corporate bodies associated with archival materials as the creators, custodians, or subjects of the records.  Such names, in the regularized format prescribed in Chapters 12-14, are used in any or all of the following contexts:  when they are recorded in the Name of Creator(s) Element (2.6 and Chapter 9) of an archival description, when they are included in an archival authority record (Chapter 11), or when they are used as index terms in the form of nominal access points to a description of records or to a description of a creator of archival materials (see Overview of Archival Description).

## Exclusions
Instructions for describing the archival materials themselves are found in Part I.

Instructions for identifying the persons, families, and corporate bodies who created, assembled, accumulated, and/or maintained and used the materials being described, as well as for providing contextual information about them, are found in Part II.

## Structure and Numbering
Part III has three chapters.  Chapter 12 provides rules for formulating the names of persons and families, Chapter 13 provides rules for formulating the names of geographic entities that are used as part of the names of corporate bodies, and Chapter 14 provides rules for formulating the names of corporate bodies.

These chapters are unlike Chapters 2-10 in that they do not provide rules for elements that form part of a description.  Instead they provide rules for the consistent formation of names of persons, families, and corporate bodies.  For that reason, they are not structured in the same way as the other chapters.  DACS has moved considerably away from the bibliographic model of AACR2, which stresses authorship, to supporting the archival emphasis on creatorship, and that shift is reflected in these rules.

The syntax of these rules is also slightly different from those of other chapters in this standard because of their origins in AACR2 which is principally concerned with the creation of only one form of descriptive format, the catalog record.  When the rules in this section direct the cataloger to “create a heading” or employ a similar phrase, they can be understood to mean, “create a name in the following standard form for use in a Name of Creator(s) Element, for inclusion in an archival authority record, or for the creation of an index term or access point in an electronic database or as the heading in a card index.”

However, the rules for formation of names in Chapters 12–14 have remained as close as possible to the most recent edition of AACR2 to ensure that a search for a particular name in an integrated catalog containing descriptions of both archival and library holdings will yield all records regardless of their nature.  The rules for formation of names differ from AACR2 only where divergence is justified by archival practice.  Minor changes to the rules have been made to make them less oriented toward published works, and some examples have been omitted or changed to make them more relevant to archival materials.  However, the numbering system utilized by AACR2 has been retained here to enable users to reference the same rules in both standards.
